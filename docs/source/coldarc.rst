      (COLDARC)
      :name: dissociated-air-flow-effects-during-plasma-arc-testing-coldarc

The COLDARC program was developed as part of an effort to predict the
heating rate and surface friction effects on the Thermal Protection
System of the Space Shuttle Orbiter during re-entry environments.
COLDARC enables the user to predict the heating rate and surface
friction on a test article during plasma arc testing. This program takes
into account the effects of dissociated air flow over the specimen and
the associated heat flux and surface temperatures. Normally, plasma arc
testing involves air flow over a test specimen having a relatively
smooth surface. Since the orbiter Thermal Protection System does not
constitute a smooth mold line surface, the COLDARC program was necessary
to assess the impact of this surface roughness and the dissociated air
flow. COLDARC uses a simplified frozen flow model to represent the
dissociated air flow and to predict the heat flux and surface friction,
including the effects or retarded atomic recombination, from test
facility data. ( Rockwell International Corp. )

This program was released by NASA through COSMIC as MSC-20522. The

-  There are no references for this program, although the names B.A.
   Miller and J.A. Bertani appear at one point in the source code.
-  :download:`Download coldarc.zip <https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5f73feb350a41e3d19b9eb79/download>`, containing the
   original source code and the source code converted to modern Fortran.
   This program remains \"in progress.\"

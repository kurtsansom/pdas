      :name: tidy---organize-fortran-source-code

The TIDY program renumbers and otherwise cleans up old and tired FORTRAN
source programs. TIDY accepts ANSI Fortran 77 with a default of 19
continuation cards as well as some IBM and CDC dialect FORTRAN
statements. It will also accept FORTRAN II and FORTRAN IV statements.
Certain FORTRAN II statements (such as READ INPUT TAPE) are
automatically translated to their FORTRAN IV equivalents. All lower case
alphabetic characters in FORTRAN keywords are normally translated to
upper case.

TIDY was one the first programs that was written at a government
facility and subsequently widely shared among the entire Fortran
community. It was originally written by Harry Murphy at Kirtland AFB.
Over the years, it has moved among facilities. For a while, my group at
NASA Ames Research Center maintained the program and Alice Barlow was
our chief programmer. It is now cared for by Ajit Thakkar at the
University of New Brunswick.

I am including this program on the CD-ROM as a convenience. The way to
keep up-to-date with the latest version is to bookmark the `Tidy
site <http://www.unb.ca/fredericton/science/chem/ajit/f_tidy.htm>`__ and
download from there. The current version is maintained by

Our thanks to Prof. Thakkar for maintaining this valuable program. I am
especially thankful because I have used TIDY on several of the programs
in this collection.

-  Download `tidy.zip <https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5f73fedf50a41e3d19b9ee34/download>`__ with the source code for
   the Tidy program.

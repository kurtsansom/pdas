#. Foss, Willard E., Jr.: A Computer Program for Detailed Analysis of
   the Takeoff and Approach Performance Capabilities of Transport
   Category Aircraft. `NASA Technical Memorandum
   80120 <_static/tm80120.pdf>`__, June 1979.

   Configuration as Affected by Airplane Rotation During the Takeoff
   Run. `NASA Technical Note D-982 <_static/tnd982.pdf>`__, October 1961.

This program is designed to follow the letter of the law in defining
takeoff and landing field lengths. The other main reference for this
program is the collection of Federal Aviation Administration
Regulations, as many of the procedures coded here are spelled out in the
regulations. You can read these regulations by going to the `FAA
Site <http://www.faa.gov/>`__ and following the link to *Federal
Aviation Regulations* under the heading *Regulations and Guidelines*.
From there, you want *Current Federal Aviation Regulations* and follow
this on to Part 25 for Commercial Transport Aircraft. This computer
program is in accordance with the regulations as of June 1979, but I
cannot guarantee its current conformance.

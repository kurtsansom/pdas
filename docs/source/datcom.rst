This computer program calculates static stability, high lift and
control, and dynamic derivative characteristics using the methods
contained in the USAF Stability and Control Datcom (**Dat**\ a
**Com**\ pendium). Configuration geometry, attitude, and Mach range
capabilities are consistent with those accommodated by the Datcom. The
program contains a trim option that computes control deflections and
aerodynamic increments for vehicle trim at subsonic Mach numbers. The
user\'s manual (on the disc) presents the program capabilities, input
and output characteristics, and example problems. User oriented features
of the program include minimized input requirements, input error
analysis, and various options for application flexibility. [Abstract

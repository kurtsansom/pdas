Interplanetary flights from Earth to the planets are an important part
of the space effort. Each flight requires a signficant detailed study,
choosing a mission profile from an infinite set of possible
combinations. A rapid, flexible Earth-Mars mission analysis program has
been developed to assist in this planning process.

This program was not released by NASA through COSMIC. The source code
was obtained from an OCR scan of NASA Technical Notes D-5985 and
D-5104..

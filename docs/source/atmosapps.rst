I have written a number of applications that utilize the Atmosphere
procedures.

-  Build atmosphere tables in both US and SI units. This is also an
   example of coding the same procedure in several different programming
   languages.
-  :doc:`Atmosphere Calculator <atmoscalc>`. This is a web application
   that lets you specify an altitude and velocity (given as Mach
   number). The static and dynamic properties of the standard atmosphere
   are calculated and displayed. I encourage you to examine the source
   code for this app. Note that the entire procedure is self-contained
   within the HTML file and requires no external server.
-  :doc:`Trajectory of a baseball <atmosbbdenver>` in ballparks of
   different altitudes. This is interesting because it answers the
   question of whether it is possible to hit a baseball further in
   Denver than in a sea-level park.
-  :doc:`Falling spheres <atmosfalling>` from high altitudes. This is
   interesting because it approximates the fall of a skydiver from very
   high altitudes. This has been of great interest since the
   demonstration of attaining supersonic speeds by a human in free fall.

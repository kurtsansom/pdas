      :name: analytical-comparisons-of-ablative-nozzle-materials-ablate

This program is designed to predict the ablation performance of rocket
nozzle heat protection materials. The program is based on the use of
nonsymmetrical difference equations that are employed to solve systems
of complex partial differential equations. The program can be used to
predict the thermal degradation of a wide variety of materials exposed
to an external source of heat. It can be generally adapted to the
simulation of processes involving heat and mass transfer by substituting
specific parameters into the basic equations. The program also includes
the effects of mass addition on heat transfer, the calculation of
internal gas pressure and internal material stresses, and a number of
other options for surface or char removal. The program has previously
been used to compare performance of phenolic nylon, phenolic graphite,
and phenolic refrasil as rocket nozzle heat protection materials. NASA
Lewis program under contract to General Electric.

This program was released by NASA through COSMIC as program LEW-00240.

   program.
-  :download:`Download ablate.zip <https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5f73feae50a41e3d19b9eb07/download>`, containing the
   original source code, the source code converted to modern Fortran,
   and a test case. The modern Fortran program compiles without errors
   or warnings and executes the test case without error messages.
   However, I do not know if the results are what is expected or the
   meaning of the input variables and the output results. Unless someone
   can help me with this, it will remain \"In Progress\".

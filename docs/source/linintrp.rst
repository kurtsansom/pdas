Line Interpolater is a simple tool that helps you compute the points you
need for input of an airplane geometrical description to an engineering
analysis program. One frequently has a line in 3D defined by two
endpoints. But additional points on this line are needed for input. You
may know one of the coordinates, but need the other two. Sometimes, you
know the fractional distance of the point between the two defining
points. This tool helps you get the numbers you need without laborious
calculation.

On the left side of the screen are six boxes for entering the (x,y,z)
coordinates of two distinct points that serve to define the line. On the
right side of the screen are four input boxes that are set up as a radio
group - that is, only one is actually active. When you click the Compute
button (or press Enter), the point on the line corresponding to the
active coordinate is used to determine the remaining unknown
coordinates.

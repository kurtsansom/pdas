The launch window for an earth satellite mission defines the dates and
the times of day that a satellite can be launched and satisfy the
mission constraints. The Parametrized Investigation of Launch
Opportunities and Trajectories (PILOT) program was developed to perform
mission simulation computations that yield data for use in delimiting
optimum launch windows. The PILOT program performs parametric scans of a
user specified trajectory over launch date and initial right ascension
of the ascending node. During each scan various mission parameters are
generated and output to a data file.

The CoPILOT utility program is used to read and format the PILOT
generated data file. The user specifies acceptable limits on the various
PILOT generated parameters, CoPILOT checks the data, and generates an
output table with notations of any constraint violations. Any time that
no constraints are violated, an acceptable launch time exists. For each
date, the acceptable launch times are printed. A printer plot may also
be generated to visually display the launch window. (Computer Sciences

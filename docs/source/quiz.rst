   Learn the international phonetic alphabet, Morse code and more\...

\"This is november-seven-nine-echo-sierra-uniform\" - a radio message
from an imaginary airplane N79ESU. If you always use these phonetic
substitutions when spelling names and other important data over noisy
communication channels, you will minimize the possibility of error. More
importantly, you will be more likely to be identified as what Roger
Bacon refers to as a Total Aviation Person in his column in Flight
Magazine.

The quiz program displays a letter and pauses for a certain length of
time before displaying the correct word substitution. After another
pause, another randomly selected letter is shown and the process
continues. Your faithful quizmaster will continue until you can call
them all with proficiency.

There are three other quizzes included with the program - Morse code and
some dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics and three-letter airport
codes. Of course, the main idea here is to show you how to set up such a
program so you can create the tables for the subject you need to learn.
Some other suggestions are

#. State capitals
#. Capitals of various countries
#. Foreign language vocabulary drill
#. Important supreme court cases
#. Nicknames of sporting teams
#. Names of airplanes, e.g. P-51 == Mustang

The complete source code for the program is included and you should be
amazed at its short length. This program is written in Delphi, so the
use of the Windows Application Programming Interface in nearly
invisible. You will need a Delphi compiler to modify the program, but
you do not need the expensive versions. This program was written with
the Standard version, which is quite reasonably priced.

Just in case you would like to have a preview of the quiz\...

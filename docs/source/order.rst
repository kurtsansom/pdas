Any of the programs may be downloaded free of charge. To do this, go to
the descriptive page for each program by clicking on its entry on the
:doc:`Contents Page <contents16>:doc:`, and find the download link near the
bottom of the page. The downloaded file will be a ZIP archive containing
the original source code, the current source code, input description (if
available), test cases (if available) and any additional descriptive
material. The available non-copyrighted references may be downloaded
from the reference page associated with each program. Instructions are
included for compiling the source code using the free `gfortran
compiler <http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/>`__ from the GNU compiler
collection.

Some people prefer to have the complete collection of programs,
instructions, test cases, references, and executables on external media.
I will continue to make a thumbdrive or CD available for a nominal
charge of $99 US, postpaid. You may order by mail by sending cash, check
or money order to PDAS, 248 Meadow Road, Santa Cruz CA 95061 USA. If you
wish to pay by PayPal or credit card, click the button below. You will
be directed to the PayPal site where you can enter your payment
information safely. If you want the CD instead of the thumbdrive, leave
a note on the Paypal page or send an email to pdaerowebmaster@gmail.com
and I will take care of you.

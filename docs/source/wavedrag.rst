   .. rubric:: Wave Drag by the Supersonic Area Rule
      :name: wave-drag-by-the-supersonic-area-rule

   The classic NASA program for computing zero lift wave drag of an
   arbitrary airplane configuration has been adapted to run on the PC.
   The source code (public domain) is included in this collection of
   aeronautical software.

The concept known as the area rule is one of the great success stories
of airplane design. The area rule says very simply that the transonic
wave drag of an aircraft is essentially the same as the wave drag of an
equivalent body of revolution having the same cross-sectional area
distribution as the aircraft. This fact, coupled with the knowledge of
the shape that minimizes drag shows designers how to reshape the
fuselage and other components of an airplane to reduce the drag of the
total configuration.

Since the rule was formulated, and verified experimentally, attempts
have been made to estimate aircraft wave drag by a theoretical analysis
of the equivalent-body area distributions. It has been found that
reasonably good wave drag estimates can be made near a Mach Number of 1
if the slender-body-theory is applied to the aircraft area distribution.
Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that the
fuselage and other components of an airplane can be reshaped in a way
that will reduce the wave drag of the total configuration. A typical
configuration will frequently have a fuselage with a local minimum of
area near the middle of its length, sometimes referred to as
\"coke-bottling\".

The transonic area rule was considered so valuable that attempts were
quickly made to extend the results to higher Mach numbers. This
theoretical effort culminated in the development of the so-called
Supersonic Area Rule, which is more complicated than the transonic rule.

This procedure can be extended to higher Mach numbers with good accuracy
by using the supersonic area rule to determine the equivalent-body area
distributions. The area distribution for the transonic area rule can be
developed with drafting techniques. The supersonic area rule depends on
computing areas intercepted by oblique cuts through a configurations and
requires a considerable amount of computational geometry.

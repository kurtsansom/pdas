   .. rubric:: References for the Digital Datcom Program
      :name: references-for-the-digital-datcom-program

The first reference is the big theoretical/empirical reference for the
program. The second, third, and fourth references are the three volumes
of the users manual for the computer program. Notice the difference in
the titles: The 4-volume paper reference is called DATCOM; the computer
program is called Digital Datcom.

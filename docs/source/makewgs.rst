Many computing procedures in engineering require the definition of a
surface or solid object by means of an ordered lattice of points that
define a grid of quadrilaterals. The computer program called MAKEWGS
enables one to make some of the classic shapes of aerodynamic theory
with a minimum of effort. A script or input file is prepared in advance
that defines the objects to be defined. The program reads the script and
creates an output file with the gridpoints in :doc:`NASA Langley Wireframe
Geometry Standard format <lawgs>`.

Wings are defined by their root and tip chords and their grid densities.
Several common airfoil sections are available. Bodies are defined by
nose length, afterbody length and overall length and maximum diameter.
The common body shapes - parabolic, conical, Sears-Haack, von Karman
Ogive, and ellipsoidal are coded.

The program naca456 is a public domain program in modern Fortran for
computing and tabulating the coordinates of the 4-digit, 4-digit
modified, 5-digit, 6-series and 6A-series of NACA airfoils. This program
is a complete revision of the NASA Langley programs for computing the
coordinates of NACA airfoils. The NASA 1996 program was used as a guide
for the development of a program that is highly modular and contains
several features that were requested by user of the older programs. This
program is a console application for which the user prepares an input
file that is read by naca456. An output file (called naca456.out)
containing the airfoil geometry is generated by the program. A file for
graphical examination is also produced.

All NACA airfoils are produced by combining a thickness distribution and
a mean line into a definition of the upper and lower surfaces of the
airfoil.

   Thickness Functions

There are three different thickness families of NACA airfoils. I have
separate pages describing the computing equations for family.

-  `4-digit <naca456thick4>`
-  `4-digit (modified) <naca456thick4m>`
-  `6-series <naca456thick6>` (includes 6A-series)

   Mean lines (also called Camber Lines)

There are several families of NACA mean lines. I have separate pages
describing the computing equations for family.

-  `2-digit <naca456mean2>`
-  `3-digit <naca456mean3>`
-  `3-digit reflex <naca456mean3r>`
-  `6-series <naca456mean6>`
-  `6A-series <naca456mean6a>`

By NACA practice,

-  Four-digit airfoils use 4-digit thickness and 2-digit camber lines.
-  Four-digit (modified) airfoils use 4-digit (modified) thickness and
   2-digit camber lines.
-  Five-digit airfoils use 4-digit thickness and 3-digit or
   3-digit(modified) camber lines.
-  6-series airfoils use 6-series thickness and 6-series camber lines.
-  6A-series airfoils use 6A-series thickness and 6A-series camber
   lines.
-  16-series airfoils use 4-digit (modified) thickness and 6-series mean
   lines with A=1.

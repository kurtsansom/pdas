The program getmac reads the definition of a wing from an arbitrary
number of chords, each defined by its spanwise location, longitudinal
position of its leading edge, and its length. The program reads the
input file and prints the area, length of MAC, y of MAC, xle of MAC, xte
of MAC, and x of c/4 of MAC. This is an example of a calculation that is
somewhat tedious if there are multiple segments to the wing.

I have included five examples of the use of getmac for wings of various
complexity. You may examine these cases at
:doc:`www.pdas.com/macex1.html <macex1>`. As always, your comments are
welcome and appreciated.

   Chord <getmacrefs>` program.

   Aerodynamic Chord Program.

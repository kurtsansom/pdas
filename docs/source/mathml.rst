When I first was introduced to the world wide web back in 1993, I
immediately decided that I would build a web site that displayed the
equations and tables in `NACA Report
1135 <https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2UKsBO-ZMVgdFdYcGRtUE14bnM>`__.
Since I was pretty good with TeX, I figured it would be a simple
project, because I assumed that there would be math tags that would let
me write equations much as I did with with TeX. Wrong!

I did manage to put about half a dozen equations on a page through the
laborious process of transforming them into GIF images. But, whenever we
got a new version of a browser, the text and images would move around
and look quite different from the way I wanted. Worst of all, the parts
of the math that were rendered in smaller font sizes (such as subscripts
or exponents) were always hard to read and even if you had some zoom
control, it just looked \"blocky\" when you enlarged the math. I lost
interest at that point although I always knew that there was a great
potential for science and engineering education if we could just work
out the details.

It has taken fifteen years, but we are finally on the verge of being
able to serve pages with readable mathematical expressions and not have
hundreds of image files with pictures of the mathematical expressions.
MathML, which stands for Mathematical Markup Language, just as HTML
stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the key to it all. I won\'t try
to explain it all here, but will give you several links that will help
you get started.

| If you simply want to read other peoples pages, you need a web browser
  that supports MathML and you need the appropriate fonts installed on
  your system. One browser that seems to work is
  `Firefox <http://www.mozilla.org>`__.
| To learn more, the best starting point is the `World Wide Web
  Consortium (W3C) <http://www.w3.org/Math/>`__ MathML page. From this
  page, there are links to many helpful pages to get you started. And to
  help you find the fonts. There is a book by Pavi Sandhu, The MathML
  Handbook, published by Charles River Media.

If you want to create your own pages with MathML, you will need help.
There are at least four ways to prepare your pages

#. You can write mathematical expressions in a simple editor such as
   Notepad, simply by knowing the syntax of MathML. Maybe you should do
   this once with an expression like a=b just to see how tedious and
   error-prone it is.
#. If you use MathType with a recent version of Microsoft Word or Corel
   WordPerfect to make web pages, there is a translator.
#. If you know TeX, you can use TtM, from `Ian
   Hutchinson <http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mml/>`__ or a similar
   procedure called MathZilla. However, the MathZilla web site seems to
   have dropped offline, which may be an ominous sign.
#. If you are familiar with the Mathematica notation for writing
   mathematical expressions, you can have them translated at `MathML
   Central <http://www.mathmlcentral.com/>`__ from Wolfram.

I have used all four techniques. Personally, I am using #3 right now
more than any other because I am making a backup version of each page as
a PDF for those who do not want to upgrade their browsers. I can go from
TeX to MathML and TeX to PDF in almost one operation. You can learn a
lot by viewing an interesting page written with MathML and selecting
\'View Page Source\'. [That also applies to HTML].

I used to have a link to an IBM product called *TechExplorer*. But, it
always shows up as a broken link and Google can\'t find it anymore, so
it must have ridden off into the sunset.

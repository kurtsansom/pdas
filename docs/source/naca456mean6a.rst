The 6A-series of cambered airfoils were described and reported in `NACA
Rep. 903 <_static/rep903.pdf>`__. They use a special form of the 6-series
camber line. This special form is designated as the \"A = 0.8 modified
mean line.\" The modification consists of holding the slope of the mean
line constant from the 85-percent chord station to the trailing edge.
This mean line is always used with 6A-series airfoils.

The equation for the 6A-series camber line is rather complicated and
there is little value in displaying it here. It may be found

#. on p.8 of `NASA TM 4741 <_static/tm4741p8.pdf>`__

   Wing Sections

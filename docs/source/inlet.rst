A computer program for calculating the flow fields in axisymmetric or
two-dimensional inlets has been written. The program has been written to
handle inlets designed with smooth compression surfaces and for which
the attached bow shock falls outside the cowl lip. The method of
characteristics has been used to calculate a uniform field of points and
at each of these points the total pressure, Mach number, local flow
angle, and static pressure ratio are printed. The numerical procedures
used are fully described and a test case is presented.

This program was not released by NASA through COSMIC. The source code
was obtained by an OCR scan of the reference document, `NASA TN
D-2897 <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2UKsBO-ZMVgMmZpY1pwZmYxekE/view?usp=sharing>`__.
Hence, there are opportunities for scanning errors.

For many years the Air Force, Navy, NASA and educational institutions
have sponsored the development of computer software that is useful to
aeronautical engineers, airplane designers, and aviation technicians.
Public Domain Aeronautical Software (PDAS) was founded to make this
treasure house of valuable software available to the aeronautical
community for use on desktop computers. These programs include
descriptions and complete public domain source code. Many programs
have sample cases (both input and output). The source code is not
copyrighted and may used in whole or in part in any of your aeronautical
studies. Most were developed under NASA or DOD sponsorship, but some are
contributions from individual authors and all have significant value
added by PDAS.

*If you loaded the DATCOM reference document from this site in the past,
be warned that there are missing pages.* Go to
:doc:`fixedDatcomDocs <fixedDatcomDocs>` to get a new copy of the
entire document with the missing pages restored. All of the files from
discs of 2012 or earlier have this problem.

-  Read the list of :doc:`frequently-asked-questions <faq>` about
   PDAS.
-  :doc:`Browse the corrected tables <avd>` for the famous book Theory
   of Airfoil Sections.
-  Download a flyer that describes the programs. You may have the `short
   version <_static/shortFlyer.pdf>`__ (2 pages) or the `long
   version <_static/longFlyer.pdf>`__ (26 pages).
-  Read the :doc:`Bug List <bug16>`
-  :doc:`Background Information <backgnd>` on Public Domain
   Aeronautical Software (Ralph Carmichael)
-  :doc:`Legal <legal>` statements about Public Domain Computer
   Programs for the Aeronautical Engineer
-  Look at my list of other sources of :doc:`aeronautical
   software <aerosoft>` or :doc:`aeronautical
   information <aeroinfo>` or to a page of
   :doc:`links <aerolink>` to aeronautical information.
-  Read my page on :doc:`Difficult Problems in
   Aeronautics <diffprob>`.
-  Some extra help for :doc:`Macintosh <macosx>` users.

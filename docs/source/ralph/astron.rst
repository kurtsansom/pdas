| `Planet                          | This site allows you to          |
| Hunters <h                       | participate in the exploration   |
| ttp://www.planethunters.org/>`__ | of stars to determine if a       |
|                                  | particular star has a planet     |
|                                  | orbiting it. The technique of    |
|                                  | light intensity analysis         |
|                                  | (photometry) over time is used   |
|                                  | to find these planets. A full    |
|                                  | tutorial and video teach you how |
|                                  | to search for exoplanets, and if |
|                                  | you are the first one to         |
|                                  | discover one, you will be        |
|                                  | invited to co-author a research  |
|                                  | paper documenting the discovery  |
|                                  | of the planet. You will analyze  |
|                                  | data from the Kepler telescope.  |
|                                  | This is an exceptional site and  |
|                                  | you will learn quite a lot about |
|                                  | exoplanets and how to detect     |
|                                  | them, and will be able to        |
|                                  | analyze data yourself to         |
|                                  | contribute to the planet hunting |
|                                  | effort.                          |

|                                  | the Hubble Space telescope. You  |
|                                  | can participate in the research  |
|                                  | by learning how to classify      |
|                                  | galaxies and then applying your  |
|                                  | knowledge to real images from    |
|                                  | Hubble. Your classifications     |
|                                  | will help complete the research  |
|                                  | on the millions of galaxies      |
|                                  | imaged by Hubble. This site will |

How Your Computer Can Participate in Astronomy Research
=======================================================

Research in astronomy can be a computationally expensive endeavor. In
order to extract meaningful information from raw data, astronomers must
crunch tremendous amounts of data, which requires an immense amount of
computational power. Through several online distributed computing
astronomy research project sites, you can learn how to become a part of
the distributed research community and can take part in the research by
allowing your computer to be used when you are not using it.

I was a great fan of Turbo Pascal during the early days of personal
computers. Even today, although I use Fortran for scientific and
numerical procedures, I still turn to Pascal (now Delphi) now and then.
The new development environment called FireMonkey enables one to write
programs for Windows and Mac OS as well as IOS with one code base.

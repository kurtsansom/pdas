|                                  | searching the various travel     |
|                                  | sites for the best fare. Enter   |
|                                  | your travel details, and         |
|                                  | BookingBuddy will point you to   |
|                                  | the different travel sites to    |
|                                  | find the best deal. I wish it    |
|                                  | would search them for me and     |
|                                  | gather the results instead of    |
|                                  | just redirecting me to them, but |
|                                  | at least BookingBuddy saves you  |
|                                  | from having to enter your travel |
|                                  | info nine times on nine          |

|                                  | power outlets, or seatbacks that |

| `AirfareWatchdog <ht             | It\'s far from the prettiest     |

|                                  | airfarewatchdog.com provides     |

|                                  | also one of the few travel sites |
|                                  | that let you search by departure |
|                                  | city, for when you just want to  |
|                                  | get out of town for a few days   |
|                                  | and don\'t really care where you |
|                                  | end up, as long as the airfare   |
|                                  | is cheap.                        |

| `FareC                           | Airline tickets are like stocks: |

|                                  | all, making it hard to know when |
|                                  | to buy. Farecast helps you know  |
|                                  | what your odds are of getting a  |
|                                  | good deal. The site is a fare    |
|                                  | aggregator similar to Kayak, but |
|                                  | it includes useful fare          |
|                                  | predictions (as opposed to       |
|                                  | Kayak\'s fare history, which     |
|                                  | Farecast also has) that guess at |

|                                  | and weeks. It even rates tickets |
|                                  | as \"Buy\" or \"Wait\" and tells |
|                                  | you how volatile the ticket      |
|                                  | price is.                        |

| `Hot                             | In our price testing for this    |
| Wire <http://www.hotwire.com>`__ | story, Hotwire had the best      |
|                                  | price for next-weekend flights.  |
|                                  | Travel partners offer Hotwire    |
|                                  | unsold inventory (plane seats,   |
|                                  | etc) at deeply discounted        |
|                                  | prices, which Hotwire then       |
|                                  | passes on to users. The only     |
|                                  | problem is that the service      |
|                                  | doesn\'t always tell you which   |
|                                  | airline you\'ll be flying or     |
|                                  | your exact flying time, so if    |
|                                  | you\'re choosy about your        |
|                                  | flights, Hotwire may not be for  |
|                                  | you.                             |

| `Kayak <http://www.kayak.com>`__ | Kayak and SideStep are the big   |
|                                  | names in aggregated ticket       |
|                                  | searching, and are owned by the  |
|                                  | same company as of December      |
|                                  | 2007. The sites comb through     |
|                                  | ticket prices from all the major |
|                                  | airlines and sites like          |
|                                  | CheapTickets.com to find you the |
|                                  | best prices. Kayak is a bit more |
|                                  | no-nonsense than the other sites |
|                                  | we looked at; you\'ll find lots  |
|                                  | of useful data, but not a lot of |
|                                  | the Web-2.0 extras that SideStep |
|                                  | and others have.                 |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| `Mobissi                         | Mobissimo does the same kind of  |
| mo <http://www.mobissimo.com>`__ | fare aggregation as Kayak and    |
|                                  | Farecast, but it puts a \"fun\"  |
|                                  | Web-2.0 skin on it. The site     |
|                                  | doesn\'t have all the robust     |
|                                  | features of Kayak and Farecast,  |
|                                  | but it does have an AJAX UI that |
|                                  | lets you move modules around, a  |
|                                  | scattershot travel blog, and     |
|                                  | Flickr, weather, and             |
|                                  | currency-converter widgets.      |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| `SideS                           | SideStep combs the same data and |
| tep <http://www.sidestep.com>`__ | uses the same basic UI as Kayak, |
|                                  | but the user experience can be   |
|                                  | quite different. It\'s ticket    |
|                                  | search results will be the same  |
|                                  | as Kayak\'s, but SideStep        |
|                                  | incorporates more content like   |
|                                  | travel guides and newsletters,   |
|                                  | and SideStep has a downloadable  |
|                                  | toolbar that offers side-by-side |
|                                  | ticket-price comparisons with    |
|                                  | travel sites like Expedia. A rep |
|                                  | for Kayak and SideStep told me   |
|                                  | that Kayak is the Google of      |
|                                  | ticket search, while SideStep is |
|                                  | the Yahoo!, and users tend to    |
|                                  | prefer one over the other.       |

| `Yapta <http://www.yapta.com>`__ | Yapta\'s downloadable plug-in    |
|                                  | tracks the prices of flights     |
|                                  | you\'re interested in, letting   |
|                                  | you know the best time to pull   |
|                                  | the trigger. But even if you     |
|                                  | don\'t want to download          |
|                                  | anything, the service can still  |
|                                  | save you money. Once you\'ve     |
|                                  | bought your ticket, enter in     |
|                                  | your flight number, travel       |
|                                  | dates, and ticket price. If the  |
|                                  | price drops below what you paid  |
|                                  | for your ticket, Yapta will let  |
|                                  | you know via e-mail so can get a |
|                                  | voucher for the price difference |
|                                  | from the airline. I\'ve done it  |
|                                  | myself and it\'s worked every    |
|                                  | time. Also, starting next month, |
|                                  | Yapta will help you find flights |
|                                  | instead of just tracking prices  |
|                                  | for you. The new Flight Finder   |
|                                  | feature will let you specify     |
|                                  | your flight preferences and      |
|                                  | track down flights that meet     |
|                                  | them.                            |

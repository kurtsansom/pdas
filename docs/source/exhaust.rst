A second order numerical method employing reference plane
characteristics has been developed for the calculation of geometrically
complex three dimensional nozzle-exhaust flow fields, heretofore
incalculable by existing methods. The nozzles may have irregular cross
sections with swept throats and may be stacked in modules using the
vehicle undersurface for additional expansion. The nozzles may have
highly nonuniform entrance conditions, the medium considered being an
equilibrium hydrogen-air mixture. The program calculates and carries
along the underexpansion shock and contact as discrete discontinuity
surfaces, for a nonuniform vehicle external flow. Additionally, shock
formation due to coalescence is detected. A wide variety of geometric
problems may be considered since the reference plane method has been
developed for three separate coordinate systems, all incorporated into a
single program. ( Advanced Technology Labs. )

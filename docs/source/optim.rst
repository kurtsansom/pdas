      direct operating cost (OPTIM)

The OPTIM computer program was developed to generate optimum vertical
profiles for turbojet powered aircraft. Specifically, OPTIM generates a
profile of altitude, airspeed, and flight path angle as a function of
range between a given set of origin and destination points for
particular models of transport aircraft. The profile may be optimized in
the sense of minimizing fuel or time or in minimizing the direct
operating cost expressed as a combination of fuel and time. Inputs to
the program include the vertical wind profile, the aircraft takeoff
weight, and the aircraft engine and aerodynamic characteristics. The
optimum vertical flight profile is generated by calculating the airspeed
and thrust required to minimize the Hamiltonian at specific energy
increments. (Analytical Mechanics Associates for NASA Langley)

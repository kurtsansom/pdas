Computer Methods for Mathematical Computations by George Forsythe,
Michael Malcolm and Cleve Moler is one of the great classic textbooks of
numerical methods for scientists and engineers. Many people (myself
included) have used the book as a reference and used the programs as
tools for a variety of computing projects. Although the algorithms are
still usable in their original pre-Fortran 77 format, the readability
and usability is greatly enhanced by using the coding style of modern
Fortran.

I have rewritten the procedures in modern Fortran. I intend to replace
the routines that were originally included with some of the aeronautical
programs with the counterparts from this library.

I do regret that I never took a class from George Forsythe. In fact, I
never met the fellow, even though my time at Stanford overlapped his.

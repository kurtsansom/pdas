As of October 2011, all of the programs in the collection are free to
download. Go to the :doc:`Contents <contents16>` page and select the
program you wish to download. There will be a link on the page where you
may download an archive file with the description and source code for
the program in question. This file will be in the ZIP format without
encryption or passwords. In most cases, there will also be instructions
and sample cases. This program page will usually have a link to a page
of references for the program. Whenever possible, within copyright
restrictions, the reference documents may be downloaded directly.

As a convenience to you, I am still making available a complete copy of
all of the programs along with instructions, references, sample cases
and executables for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux on thumbdrive or CD
for a nominal charge of $99.

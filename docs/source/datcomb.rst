The fundamental reference for the computational procedures in Digital
Datcom is the original printed document, USAF Data Compendium for
Stability and Control (DATCOM). You may `download a
copy <https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2UKsBO-ZMVgMXZqVmFjcnR3dlU>`__
of this report in PDF.

If you want a printed copy of this document, you can simply print from
the PDF. However, this is a big document. Even with two-sided printing,
my copy occupies four big 3-inch loose-leaf binders. When printing a
document of this size, you need to consider that you will be loading the
paper tray many, many times and you will probably exhaust a toner
cartridge in the process. I don\'t even want to think about using an
inkjet printer.

If you value your time, you should consider ordering a copy from a
company known as IHS/Global. They have a good original and will make
excellent two-sided copies for you and punch them and put them in
loose-leaf binders. As of January 2010, their price was $195. You may
reach them by e-mail at global@ihs.com or by telephone at 877-413-5184.

I ordered my copy of the documents directly from their web site at
`global.ihs.com <http://global.ihs.com>`__.
